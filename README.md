# OSCP-Prep

Personal preparation repository for the **OSCP** (Offensive Security Certified Professional) certification.

## Content

This repo contains my notes, flowcharts, cheatsheets and methodology built during my OSCP preparation.

### Flowcharts

Visual decision-tree flowcharts for enumeration and exploitation, organized by protocol/service:

- **SMB** - SMB enumeration & exploitation with Metasploit

> **Note:** SVG flowcharts may not render well directly on GitHub due to their size. Click on the file then use the **"Raw"** button to view them in full resolution.
